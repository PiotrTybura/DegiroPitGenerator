# DegiroPitGenerator

## How to use?
1. Download the newest Source Code
2. Put your Degiro Username and Password into appsettings.json
3. Compile it
4. Start DegiroPitGenerator.exe with year param (for instance `2020`)
5. After a couple of seconds the Json file with all crucial PIT-38 fields opens

## Motivation
Degiro does not provide PIT-8C (the Polish tax Report) so if you are a Polish citizen then you need to calculate the tax by yourself. There is a general Degiro yearly report that some people use for this purpose, however it provides exchange rates that are not accepted by the Polish Tax Office.
