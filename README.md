# DegiroPitGenerator

## How to use?
1. Download the newest Release
2. Put your Degiro Username and Password into appsettings.json'
3. Start DegiroPitGenerator.exe
4. After a couple of seconds the Json file with all crucial PIT-38 fields opens
## Motivation
Degiro does not provide PIT-8C (the Polish tax Report) so if you are a Polish citizen then you need to calculate the tax by yourself. There is a general Degiro yearly report that some people use for this purpose, however it provides exchange rates that are not accepted by the Polish Tax Office.
