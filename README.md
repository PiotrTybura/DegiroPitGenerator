# DegiroPitGenerator

## How to run the release
1. Download the latest Release from Github
2. Put your Degiro Username and Password into appsettings.json
3. Start DegiroPitGenerator.exe with year param (for instance `2020`)
4. After a couple of seconds the Json file with all crucial PIT-38 fields opens

## How to compile & run?
The process is almost the same as running the release. The only difference is you need to download the source code instead of release and compile it.

## Motivation
Degiro does not provide PIT-8C (the Polish tax Report) so if you are a Polish citizen then you need to calculate the tax by yourself. There is a general Degiro yearly report that some people use for this purpose, however it provides exchange rates that are not accepted by the Polish Tax Office.
